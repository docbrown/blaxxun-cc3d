These nodes are not implemented in other VRML tools. 
If VRML files with GLView nodes should be loadable in other tools, 
the proper fields declaration could be exported by saving the file from GLView. <P>

<H2>New GLView 2.09 Nodes </H2>

<H2><A NAME="Image">Image</A> </H2>

Image is similar to the Texture2 node, but the image will
be displayed as 2d image at the current coordinate system (0,0,0) location
starting with the lower left pixel of the image.
<P>


If an alpha value is specified the image alpha channel will be set to
this alpha value.
If both an alpha value and an alphaColor is specified, the alpha value of
all pixels matching the alphaColor will be set to the alpha value. This feature
can be used to make parts of an image transparent, so that other 
objects are shining through. Normally an image should have a constant color background e.g. black or white, so that the
alphaColor could easily be specified like 0,0,0 or 1,1,1
<P>
After all operations image will contain the resulting image.
<P>
In the default rendering mode, transparent pixels (Alpha == 0) will be skipped.



<PRE>
Image {
    // Fields.
    SFString    filename   // url/file to read image from
    SFImage     image      // or the image specified inline
    
    SFFloat     alpha      // default 1.0, alpha Value of  the image
    SFColor     alphaColor; // default black, alpha comparison color 
}
</PRE>

Example:
render a transparent bitmap, the starting point rotates with the camera

<PRE>
 
    Separator {
        Translation { translation -1 -1 0 }
        Image { filename "imageWithBlackBackground.bmp"  alphaColor 0 0 0  alpha 0.0 }
    }
</PRE>




<P>


<H2><A NAME="ScaledImage">ScaledImage</A> </H2>
The ScaledImage node scales an child image node.
<P>


<PRE>

ScaledImage {
    // Fields
    // all field of Image ++ 
    
    enum ScaleMode {
            NONE,
            TO_WINDOW,      // scale relative to the current window size
            TO_SIZE,        // scale to absolute pixel size
            BY_FACTOR,      // scale relative by float factor
    }

    SFNode         srcImage    // the source image to scale, default NULL
    
    SFEnum         scale       // scale mode, default NONE
    SFVec2f        scaleFactor // scale factor
}
</PRE>

Examples are in the layer section.

<P>

One of the factors in scaleFactor can be 0, in this case scaling preserve the aspect
of the original image. Scale factors can be negative, in this case the image is mirrored
along the axis.
<P>

After all operations the field image will contain the resulting image.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="ImageElevationGrid">ImageElevationGrid</A></H2>

This node turns an arbitrary pixel image into a 3D Landscape.
This feature is also somtimes called Heightfield.


<PRE>

ImageElevationGrid {

    SFNode heightImage    // an Image Node, default : NULL  
    SFFloat heightScale   // additional heightScale factor for images values, default: 1.0
    SFNode colorImage     // an Image Node for per vertex colors, default : NULL   
    
    
    // fields from ElevationGrid 
    
    SFLong      xDimension  // x direction, Default 0
    SFFloat     xSpacing    // x direction  Default 1.0
    SFLong      zDimension  // z direction  Default 0
    SFFloat     zSpacing    // x direction  Default 1.0

    MFFloat     height      // height array default [] 

}
</PRE>

The field heightImage must contain an Image node e.g.

<PRE>
ImageElevationGrid {
    heightImage Image ( filename "mandrill.bmp") 
}
</PRE>

ImageElevationGrid is derived from ElevationGrid, fields from ElevationGrid
will be computed from the heightImage :

<PRE>

    xDimension = Width of heightImage
    zDimension = Height of heightImage

    if (xSpacing == 0) xSpacing = 1.0 / xDimension
    if (zSpacing == 0) zSpacing = 1.0 / zDimension

    height[i,j] = heightFactor * grayValue(pixel[i,j]) / 255.0
</PRE>

<P>
ShapeHints + per vertex material bindings can be applied as usual in VRML 1.0
Texture could be used with this node.
A better way is to specify also an image (texture) to compute vertex colors
for the height field by using a second colorImage, instead of using texture mapping.

Often the height and the color image could be shared e.g. 

<PRE>
ImageElevationGrid {
    heightImage DEF myImage Image ( filename "mandrill.bmp") 
    colorImage USE myImage 
}

</PRE>


Depending onn Computer performance and memory, the images should not be to large.
Images sizes of 128*128, 256* 256 are sufficient.
An image could be read in as Heightfield by using the GLView command File->New->Heightfield from image.

<H2><A NAME="Layer">Layer</A> </H2>

The Layer node allows image composition effects.
The Layer behaves like a Separator but sets up a new camera space and optionally enables 
OpenGL specific rendering functions like alpha blending.
<P>
The camera space for the child nodes in Layer is set up to view the xy plane from (-1,-1) to (1,1).
Note that this space exactly maps to the window, and that objects can appear
distorted if the windows aspect ratio is not 1.
<P>

A general VRML graph setup would be :
<PRE>

Render an image  in the foreground, make all black pixels of the image transparent, make the image
25 % of the window size :

#VRML V1.0 ascii

  ... Normal VRML scene goes here 

Layer {
     depthWrite FALSE   //  we don´t need the z-buffer
     depthFunc ALWAYS   // this disables z-test

                srcImage Image {  filename "glview.bmp"  alphaColor 0 0 0  alpha 0.0  }
     }   
}

Instead of the alpha test, blending can be enabled to mix partly transparent objects
on top of the current display. For images the alpha channel can be used, for other geometry
a transparency can be specified in a material node.

Blend a 50% transparent image ontop of the lower left part of the window.

This node creates a rectangular grid of varying height, especially useful in modeling terrain.
The model is primarily described by a scalar array of height values that specify the height of
the surface above each point of the grid. 
<P>
The zDimension (rows) and xDimension (columns) fields indicate the number of grid points in the
X and Z directions, respectively, defining a grid of (zDimension-1) x
(xDimension-1) rectangles. 
<P>
The vertex locations for the rectangles are defined by the height field and the gridStep field:

     The height field is an array of scalar values representing the height above the grid for
     each vertex. The height values are stored so that row 0 is first, followed by rows 1, 2, ...
     verticesPerColumn-1. Within each row, the height values are stored so that column 0 is
     first, followed by columns 1, 2, ... xDimension-1. 
<P>
Thus, the vertex corresponding to the ith row and jth column is placed at 

( xSpacing * j, height[ i* xDimension + j ], zSpacing * i ) 

in object space, where 

0 <= i < xDimension and 

0 <= j < zDimension. 
<P>
All points in a given row have the same Z value, with row 0 having the smallest Z value. All
points in a given column have the same X value, with column 0 having the smallest X value. 
<P>
The default texture coordinates range from [0,0] at the first vertex to [1,1] at the far side of
the diagonal. The S texture coordinate will be aligned with X, and the T texture coordinate
with Z.

<H2><A NAME="Extrusion">Extrusion (Vrml 2.0 Node)</A> </H2>
from VRML 2.0 spec :
    http://vag.vrml.org/vrml10c.html


Extrusion
<P>
The Extrusion node is used to define shapes based on a two dimensional cross
section extruded along a three dimensional spine. The cross section can be scaled
and rotated at each spine point to produce a wide variety of shapes. 
<P>
An Extrusion is defined by a 2D crossSection piecewise linear curve (described
as a series of connected vertices), a 3D spine piecewise linear curve (also
described as a series of connected vertices), a list of 2D scale parameters, and a
list of 3D orientation parameters. Shapes are constructed as follows: The
cross-section curve, which starts as a curve in the XZ plane, is first scaled about
the origin by the first scale parameter (first value scales in X, second value scales
in Z). It is then rotated about the origin by the first orientation parameter, and
translated by the vector given as the first vertex of the spine curve. It is then
extruded through space along the first segment of the spine curve. Next, it is
scaled and rotated by the second scale and orientation parameters and extruded
by the second segment of the spine, and so on. 
<P>
A transformed cross section is found for each joint (that is, at each vertex of the
spine curve, where segments of the extrusion connect), and the joints and
segments are connected to form the surface. No check is made for
self-penetration. Each transformed cross section is determined as follows: 
<P>
  1.Start with the cross section as specified, in the XZ plane. 
  2.Scale it about (0, 0, 0) by the value for scale given for the current joint. 
  3.Apply a rotation so that when the cross section is placed at its proper location
     on the spine it will be oriented properly. Essentially, this means that the cross
     section's Y axis (up vector coming out of the cross section) is rotated to align
     with an approximate tangent to the spine curve. 
<P>
     For all points other than the first or last: The tangent for spine[i] is found by
     normalizing the vector defined by (spine[i+1] - spine[i-1]). 
<P>
     If the spine curve is closed: The first and last points need to have the same
     tangent. This tangent is found as above, but using the points spine[0] for
     spine[i], spine[1] for spine[i+1] and spine[n-2] for spine[i-1], where
     spine[n-2] is the next to last point on the curve. The last point in the curve,
     spine[n-1], is the same as the first, spine[0]. 
<P>
     If the spine curve is not closed: The tangent used for the first point is just the
     direction from spine[0] to spine[1], and the tangent used for the last is the
     direction from spine[n-2] to spine[n-1]. 
<P>
     In the simple case where the spine curve is flat in the XY plane, these
     rotations are all just rotations about the Z axis. In the more general case
     where the spine curve is any 3D curve, you need to find the destinations for
     all 3 of the local X, Y, and Z axes so you can completely specify the rotation.
     The Z axis is found by taking the cross product of 

     (spine[i-1] - spine[i]) and (spine[i+1] - spine[i]). 
<P>
     If the three points are collinear then this value is zero, so take the value from
     the previous point. Once you have the Z axis (from the cross product) and the
     Y axis (from the approximate tangent), calculate the X axis as the cross
     product of the Y and Z axes. 
<P>
  4.Given the plane computed in step 3, apply the orientation to the cross-section
     relative to this new plane. Rotate it counter-clockwise about the axis and by
     the angle specified in the orientation field at that joint. 
<P>  
  5.Finally, the cross section is translated to the location of the spine point. 
<P>
Surfaces of revolution: If the cross section is an approximation of a circle and the
spine is straight, then the Extrusion is equivalent to a surface of revolution, where
the scale parameters define the size of the cross section along the spine. 
<P>
Cookie-cutter extrusions: If the scale is 1, 1 and the spine is straight, then the
cross section acts like a cookie cutter, with the thickness of the cookie equal to
the length of the spine. 
<P>
Bend/twist/taper objects: These shapes are the result of using all fields. The spine
curve bends the extruded shape defined by the cross section, the orientation
parameters twist it around the spine, and the scale parameters taper it (by scaling
about the spine). 
<P>
Extrusion has three parts: the sides, the beginCap (the surface at the initial end of
the spine) and the endCap (the surface at the final end of the spine). The caps
have an associated SFBool field that indicates whether it exists (TRUE) or doesn't
exist (FALSE). 
<P>
When the beginCap or endCap fields are specified as TRUE, planar cap surfaces
will be generated regardless of whether the crossSection is a closed curve. (If
crossSection isn't a closed curve, the caps are generated as if it were -- equivalent
to adding a final point to crossSection that's equal to the initial point. Note that an
open surface can still have a cap, resulting (for a simple case) in a shape
something like a soda can sliced in half vertically.) These surfaces are generated
even if spine is also a closed curve. If a field value is FALSE, the corresponding
cap is not generated. 
<P>
Extrusion automatically generates its own normals. Orientation of the normals is
determined by the vertex ordering of the triangles generated by Extrusion. The
vertex ordering is in turn determined by the crossSection curve. If the
crossSection is drawn counterclockwise, then the polygons will have
counterclockwise ordering when viewed from the 'outside' of the shape (and vice
versa for clockwise ordered crossSection curves). 
<P>
Texture coordinates are automatically generated by extrusions. Textures are
mapped like the label on a soup can: the coordinates range in the U direction from
0 to 1 along the crossSection curve (with 0 corresponding to the first point in
crossSection and 1 to the last) and in the V direction from 0 to 1 along the spine
curve (again with 0 corresponding to the first listed spine point and 1 to the last).
When crossSection is closed, the texture has a seam that follows the line traced
by the crossSection's start/end point as it travels along the spine. If the endCap
and/or beginCap exist, the crossSection curve is cut out of the texture square and
applied to the endCap and/or beginCap planar surfaces. The beginCap and
endCap textures' U and V directions correspond to the X and Z directions in
which the crossSection coordinates are defined.

<P>
For extruded text the value for extrusion should be [0 0 0, 0 0 DEPTH] where DEPTH is the
desired depth of the extrusion. 
<P>
Standard attribute width of AsciiText is not implemented.
If parts has the INVERT property explicitely set, GLView compute a 2d bounding box for text,
scales this box by invertScale and subtracts the text from this box, to create a "inverted"
string.

}
</PRE>

Derived from Rotation:
Applies a rotation depending on time. For the above values 
a 360 degree rotation during one time step will be applied.

Animation starts using the Render->Time->Start button.

Derived from Translation
Applies a translation from translation0 to translation1 depending on time.

<H2><A NAME="Blinker">Blinker</A> </H2>

    upto        FALSE       #SFBool      traverse from children 0 upto current if TRUE
    
    ... List of Nodes
}
</PRE>

Derived from Switch

Traverses childs depending on time. Cycles through all children in one time step. The global time
is transformed to localTime = globalTime * speed + offset. If the Blinker has only one child,
the child is toggled on and off.

Blinker can be used to blink different childs with geometry, but could also blink some
properties like Material, Texture2, Transforms and so on.
To create a simple video animation create a node like :

<PRE>
    Blinker {
        Texture2{}
        Texture2{}
        Texture2{}
    }
</PRE>
Blinking of Coordinate3, TextureCoordinate2, Material nodes with local Materialbindings,
Normals is currently not supported.


<H2><A NAME="TextureRotor">TextureRotor</A> </H2>
<PRE>

TextureRotor {
    rotation 0 0 1 TWOPI    #SFRotation  Rotation axis and value

    on          TRUE        #SFBool      enable/disable switch
    offset      0           #SFFloat     additional offset 
}
</PRE>
Similar to Rotor, TextureRotor applies a time dependent rotation for the texture transformation.
